Difference between graceful degredation and Service Workers:
Graceful degredation is all about designing your web app so that it still works with limited functionality in older browsers or simply under poor conditions. Instead of simply breaking, your web app can still be used. Service workers allows you to load faster, run offline, and handle error and fallback requests by running background scripts that can intercept and cache netwok requests. And actually, Service Workers is a form of network-level-degredation. Overall it allows you to be less dependent on the network.
